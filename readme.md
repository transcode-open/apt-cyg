apt-cyg is a simple script. To install first make sure you have lynx and/or wget installed. In Cygwin run:

  cygcheck -c

If they are not installed, open a terminal (cmd,powershell or Cmder) then find your Cygwin installation .exe file (i.e. setup-x86_64.exe) then run:

    setup-x86_64.exe -q -P lynx wget
    
Then you can install apt-cyg:

    lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
    install apt-cyg /bin

Example use of apt-cyg:

    apt-cyg install nano
